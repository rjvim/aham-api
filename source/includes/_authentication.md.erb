# Authentication


We have to pass the token for all the api which require authentication.

We have to pass token in `Authorization` Header.

Also we have to pass Accept header to mention the version of the api we are using.

Please note: version of api is mentioned along with each end point.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/x.aham.v1+json
```

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://ahamlearning.com/ahamapi/learner/authenticate"
  -H "Accept: application/x.aham.v1+json"
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -d '
    <%= prettify_json(partial("requests/authentication.json.erb")) %>
  '
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
    "result": "success",
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOjc0MSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cDovL2FoYW12Mi50ZXN0L2FoYW1hcGkvbGVhcm5lci9hdXRoZW50aWNhdGUiLCJpYXQiOjE1NDIyNjM0ODQsImV4cCI6MTkwMjI2MzQ4NCwibmJmIjoxNTQyMjYzNDg0LCJqdGkiOiJwdkdYczRMeXVzTGdqQ05mIn0.aharGKtleL308SYFVGPkoJlJ_VYx68j4GWnL0fLgIrM"
